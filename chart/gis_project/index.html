        <p id="first-article" class="article">Smoking cigarettes has been “out of trend” for a while. In the late 1990s
            and early 2000s smoking in most
            workplaces and public places was prohibited in many countries. People started being more aware of their
            eating habits, physical activities and, overall health. In the USA, current smoking has declined from
            20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 14.0% (14 of every 100 adults) in 2019, and the
            proportion of ever smokers who have quit has increased
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm">(Centers
                for Disease Control and Prevention)</a>.
            <br><br>

            However, cigarette smoking is not just a simple bad habit but a strong addiction whether it is addiction to
            nicotine or psycho emotional addiction. Most of the time, it is both.
            Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United
            States, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths every year, or about 1 in 5 deaths.<br>
            In this project I explore the average cost of cigarettes per pack, federal and state tax on cigarettes, and
            the
            relation between these factors and adult smoking consumption from 1970 to 2019 in the United Stated.

            overall U.S.
            cigarette
            consumption from 1970 to 2019 show that there is a strong correlation between increasing prices and

        <p style="font-size: 20px;" class="article"> Decreasing cigarette consumption among adults strongly correlates
            with
            increasing average cost of cigarettes. However, interestingly, the higher income people have the less they
            smoke. This means that smoking consumption depends not only from the cost of the cigarettes, but many other
            factors, which might include annual household income, level of education, marital status, and whether person
            has
            experienced anxiety.</p>
